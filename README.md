I came across this project in 2015 which turned a raspberry pi into a handheld retro gaming device.

I had plans to use this to also control my very early smart home devices and eventually robots with live video streaming. Because I chose to make slight modifications to the circuitry, I tried making the keyboard manager myself. Sadly, this project was never finished and eventually needed to be taken apart. Someday, I might try again and update here.
